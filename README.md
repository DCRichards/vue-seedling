## Linting & Code Style

This project uses a number of tools and configurations to enforce an opinionated and rigorous code style. These are run as you save by the dev server and can also be run using:

```bash
# Docker
docker-compose --rm web yarn lint

## No Docker
yarn lint
```

#### ESLint

JavaScript/Vue linting is provided by [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and follows [eslint-config-airbnb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-airbnb) and [vue/strongly-recommended](https://eslint.vuejs.org/rules/), with the following adjustments:

* `max-len` which is set to 150 to accommodate the verbosity of HTML in Vue templates.
* `vue/html-closing-bracket-newline` which is set to `never` for both single and multiline HTML. Why? Because closing braces floating on their own line are ugly.

**Config file**: `.eslintrc.js`

#### Stylelint

CSS/SCSS linting is provided by [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) and follows [stylelint-config-recommended](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stylelint-config-recommended) and [stylelint-scss](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stylelint-scss), with the following adjustments:

* `rule-empty-line-before` which is set to `always`, because space is not only the final frontier, but also paramount to readable (S)CSS.

**Config file**: `stylelint.config.js`


## Testing

Tests can be run with the following:

```bash
# Docker
docker-compose --rm web yarn test

## No Docker
yarn test
```

## Configuration

#### vue.config.js

Configuration of the build process and any extensions of the bundled webpack configuration are found in here. Hopefully you won't need to open touch this unless you need to add a new Webpack plugin or loader.

The full documentation can be found at [cli.vuejs.org/config](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/#vue-config-js).

## Project structure

The project follows the standard vue.js template as generated by the [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/).
